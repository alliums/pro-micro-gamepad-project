electronics project 1 - gamepad

objective: make a universal USB gamepad.

detailed objectives:
make a gamepad with standard # of buttons (4 left, 4 right, 2 joysticks, 2 shoulders)
design/manufacture PCB to fit in gamepad housing
develop HID driver to use gamepad over USB

success criterion:
plays games
passes smell test

reason for undertaking this project:
develop knowledge of MCU dev/programming, circuit design/manufacturing, HID drivers, hardware design
build up to pspi or similar larger embedded projects - learning just the (simplest) physical input portion, leave other aspects (audio handling, display handling, etc) for later

stages:
technical prototyping (arduino stage)
  using atmega32u4-based Arduino (I chose a knockoff Pro Micro), connect correct # of buttons/joysticks, get input
  develop HID driver, use it
device design
  design PCB (arduino minus unnecessary shit plus inputs)
  design enclosure
  3d print dead mockups
  3d print, build working mockup
finalize design
  physical prototyping
  manufacture PCB (china)
  manufacture housing (3d print or order)
  put it all together
